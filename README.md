# Ubuntu Dev Box for training/dev purposes

This vagrant setup serves as a starting point for development trainings.
It sets up a ubuntu development vm with preinstalled software packages.

# Services

The current version installs the following services on the VM:
* PostgreSQL - [Documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
    * User: vagrant
    * Password: vagrant
* RabbitMQ - [Documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html)
* MySQL - [Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
    * User: root
    * Password: vagrant

All services can be accessed from the host system using their default ports and the host 127.0.0.1. For a list of forwarded ports please refer to the [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile).

For a general description about database technologies and choice please have a look [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-sql-and-nosql-databases-and-different-database-models).

!!! And please never use Redis to store persistent data. Redis should be used only as a cache !!!
